// create a function to take in all the password criteria
  //prompt user for length of password and save it as a variable
  //check to make sure the length is between 8 and 128 characters
  //confirm lowercase, uppercase numeric, and special characters
  //validate that one of the 4 options were selected 
  //create an object to store the user input

//create a separate global array for each of the 4 confirmations

//inside generatePassword function 
  //create a variable to store user input from the password option function 
  //create a new array that will take in all possible characters that can be used for new password
  //create conditional statements to push into possible character array....ie if the user selected lower case then we need to push those elements in the lowercase array into possible character array. 
  //loop through the possible character array and return characters based on the length given by user
  //return the result and pass to be generated on the page 

  //need to assure that the newly created password has at least 1 character for each of the criteria selected.
